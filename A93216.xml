            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SHORT HISTORICAL ACCOUNT, Concerning the Succeſſion to the Crovvn of SCOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND: And the Eſtates diſpoſing of it upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion as they thought fit.</head>
            <p>VVHen <hi>Fergus</hi> the firſt was choſen King the Eſtates gave the Crown to him his Heirs and Succeſſors, and confirmed it by an Oath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fergus</hi> being deceaſed, leaving two Sons <hi>Ferleg,</hi> and <hi>Main,</hi> who being but young were not for Governing; and the Eſtates being conveened, chooſed a King: And there being great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt among them, it was objected by one partie, that the Crown having been given to <hi>Fergus</hi> and his Heirs, and the Eſtates having confirmed it by an Oath, they could not paſs by his Son and chooſe another King; and on the other hand it was pleaded, that the Eſtates should conſider that there were great dangers both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad if they should admit a Chind to be King. And after being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated they came to this Reſolution; that notwithſtanding their Oath given to <hi>Fergus,</hi> yet when their King dies, leaving Children, who in reſpect of their age are not fit for Governing, that the next of the Line who is fitteſt to Govern should be King; and that after his deceaſe the Crown should return to the former King's Children; upon which, <hi>Feritharis, Pergus</hi> his Brother was choſen King, and this Law continued for the ſpace of one thouſand years, from <hi>Feritharis</hi> his time, to <hi>Kenneth</hi> the Third, who (as the hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſayes) by force and fraud, obtained this Law to be changed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferleg, Fergus</hi> his eldeſt Son, when he came to age, being ambitious to Reign entered into a conſpiracie againſt <hi>Feritharis,</hi> which being diſcovered, he was taken and impriſoned, but eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome of his accomplices, and few Months after <hi>Feritharis</hi> having died, it was thought he got wrong by <hi>Ferleg,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151716:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 44 -->upon the preſumptions of <hi>Ferleg</hi> his former ambition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie, and ſudden ſlight, <hi>Ferleg,</hi> by unanimous conſent of the Eſtates, was condemned and deprived of the Right and Succeſſion to the Crown, and <hi>Main</hi> his Brother was made King.</p>
            <p>Albeit by the Law made in <hi>Fergus</hi> the firſt's time, the Eſtates granted the Crown to the King and his Heirs, which was confirmed by Oath, yet when the Eſtates found it not for the intereſt of the Nation, that the Crown should deſcend upon the Kings Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and immediate Heirs, They conferred it upon another of the ſame Line, as in the caſe of the tvvo Sons of <hi>Durſtus</hi> vvho albeit they vvere of age fit for Governing vvhen their Father died, yet the Eſtates conſidering, that if they should admit any of <hi>Durſtus</hi> his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the Crown, (who had been a wicked King and had forced his Subjects to a conſpiracy againſt him) the likeneſs of manners might make them continue in their Fathers vvickedneſs, and the neereneſs of Blood incite them to revenge: Therefore they paſſed by <hi>Durſtus</hi> his tvvo ſons, and chooſed <hi>Evven Durſtus</hi> his Cuſine German to be King.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Ferchard</hi> his Reign, the Eſtates conveened by their ovvn authority, and having cited the King to appear before them, he refuſed to appear, and having retired to a ſtrong caſtle, the Eſtates did take him out, and brought him before them, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſed him of many heinous Crimes, and particularly that he vvas guilty of the pelagian Hereſie, and contempt of the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and other holy Rites; and he not being able to clear himſelf of the Crimes, vvith vvhich he vvas charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vvas put in Priſon and shortly after died.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> when he was firſt ſettled upon the Throne having only a Daughter who by the Law should have ſucceeded, there was a new Law made, that if the King should die without Male Children, his Brother <hi>Edvvard</hi> and his Sons should ſucceed; and if he should die without Children, that then King <hi>Robert's</hi> Daughter and her Heirs should ſucceed to the Crown: But it was provided that the Eſtates should chooſe a Husband for her, that was moſt fit to govern, for they thought it was much more reaſonable that they should chooſe their King, than that the Queen should chooſe her Husband. And there after the King having a Son, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151716:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 44 -->another Daughter, the entail was again altered, and the Crown was provided to King <hi>Robert</hi> and his Children: and they failing to <hi>Robert Stevvart</hi> the Kings Grand-child, by his eldeſt Daughter, paſſing by his two Daughters, Which ſettlement the Eſtates did confirm by Oath: And yet that notwithſtanding <hi>David</hi> the ſecond, King <hi>Robert's</hi> Son, did alter this Law and Settlement, and made a new Law, excluding <hi>Robert Stevvart,</hi> and ſubſtituting <hi>Alexander,</hi> Son to the Earle of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> by King <hi>Robert's</hi> ſecond Daughter, which the Eſtates did likeways confirm by Oath, but <hi>Alexander</hi> having died shortly after, and King <hi>David</hi> being reconciled to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Stevvart,</hi> he was by Act of Parliament reſtored to his own place in the Succeſſion.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Robert,</hi> who was the firſt King of the Race of <hi>Stewart,</hi> being firſt married to the Earle of <hi>Roſs</hi> his Daughter, by whom he had two Sons, and a Daughter, did after the Queen's deceaſe, marry <hi>Elizabeth Muir</hi> with whom he had begotten three Sons before his marriage with the Earle of <hi>Roſs</hi> his Daughter. And albeit the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſe of Succeſſion was not only eſtablished by Law, but confirmed by Oath; Yet the Eſtates did again alter it and entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Crown upon <hi>Elizabeth Muire<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From all which theſe things may be evidently inferred.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That by the conſtitution of the Government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there was an original Contract betwixt the King and the People by which their Kings were oblidged to Rule by Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That when the Kings made Invaſion upon Religion and the Law and Liberties of the Subject, tending to the ſubverſion of the Government, the Eſtates did conveen by their own Authority and called their Kings in queſtion for it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Eſtats have been in uſe to alter the courſe of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, when they did ſee it for the Intereſt and Well of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and did entail the Crown to others than thoſe who by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Laws had Right to ſucceed, keeping alvvays the ſame Family.</p>
